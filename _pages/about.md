Hi, I’m Alex Loftus. I am currently a data scientist at Creyon Bio; previously, I was a machine learning engineer at Blue Halo, and a master's student at Johns Hopkins University.

I’ve been fortunate to work with a number of brilliant people over the last few years and have found considerable success as a result. I worked with Professor Joshua Vogelstein in the Johns Hopkins Biomedical Engineering department to build a pipeline to create graphs from MRI data, which led to a paper in-review at Nature Methods. My second project was a textbook on spectral graph theory, which I’m delighted to be publishing with a co-author with Cambridge University Press. We also developed an open-source project, Graspologic, which was acquired by Microsoft and subsequently used to measure collaboration changes in their workforce during COVID. This year, I began giving talks for the San Diego Machine Learning meetup group, where I joined a team competing in the Vesuvius Ink Detection Kaggle Competition. We won 1st place against 1,249 teams for a competition prize pool of $100,000.

I have multimodal research interests which span across natural language processing and computer vision, with the common thread being an excitement about inference-time knowledge editing and knowledge understanding techniques. I am particularly interested in using my background in spectral graph theory to bring new ideas into this area of research.
