About Me
---
Hi, I’m **Alex Loftus**. I am currently a data scientist at [Creyon Bio](creyonbio.com); Prior to this, I was a machine learning engineer at [Blue Halo](https://bluehalo.com/), and a master's student in biomedical engineering, with a data science focus, at Johns Hopkins University.

I’ve been fortunate to work with a number of brilliant people over the last few years. Here are some fun projects which resulted:
 - I worked with [Professor Joshua Vogelstein](neurodata.io) in the Johns Hopkins Biomedical Engineering department to build a [pipeline to create graphs from MRI data](https://github.com/neurodata/m2g), which led to a paper in-review at Nature Methods. 
 - I co-authored a [textbook on spectral graph theory](docs.neurodata.io/graph-stats-book/coverpage.html), which we are publishing with with Cambridge University Press. 
 - We developed an open-source project, [Graspologic](github.com/microsoft/graspologic), which was acquired by Microsoft and used to measure collaboration changes in their workforce during COVID. 
 - This year, I began [giving talks](https://www.youtube.com/@SanDiegoMachineLearning/videos) for the San Diego Machine Learning meetup group, where I joined a team competing in the [Vesuvius Ink Detection Kaggle Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/vesuvius-challenge-ink-detection). We won 1st place against 1,249 teams for a competition prize pool of $100,000.

I have multimodal research interests which span across natural language processing and computer vision, with the common thread being an excitement about inference-time knowledge editing and knowledge understanding techniques. I am particularly interested in using my background in spectral graph theory to bring new ideas into this area of research.

## Talks & Publications
- [Hands-on Network Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and Graspologic](http://docs.neurodata.io/graph-stats-book/coverpage.html): Textbook, 2023, Cambridge University Press. Second author, contributed roughly half the pages and figures.
- [A low-resource reliable pipeline to democratize multi-modal connectome estimation and analysis](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.11.01.466686v1): Paper, 2022, Nature Methods, under review. Second author, wrote most of the infrastructure for the codebase.
- [Working with LLMs](https://lu.ma/aisd1): Talk, 2023, for 100 people at the AIML San Diego meetup
- [What Happened at ICML?](https://www.youtube.com/@SanDiegoMachineLearning/videos): Talk for the San Diego Machine Learning group summarizing ICML posters
- [1st Place Solution - Vesuvius Ink Competition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWySc8s00P0): Presentation, 2023, for 60 people. Presenting on our winning solution to a \$100,000 Kaggle competition.
- [Effects of an unc-43 (CaMKII) Gene Deletion on Short-Term Memory for Associative Conditioning in C. elegans](): Talk, presented at Psychfest, 2017, Bellingham, WA.
- [Role of CAMKII in Associative Conditioning and GLR-1 Expression in C. Elegans](): Poster, presented at Society for Neuroscience, 2017, Washington, DC. Later author, conducted most of the later experiments.

### Background and Misc Info
I grew up in Seattle, WA and studied behavioral neuroscience during my undergraduate years, with a philosophy minor and an early interest in theory of mind. I got interested in math and programming and started a computational neuroscience club, where I taught weekly seminars. I also spent a lot of time partner dancing and playing guitar at open mic nights!
