Hi, I’m **Alex Loftus**. I am a textbook author, communicator, kaggle competition winner, and PhD student with [David Bau's group](https://baulab.info/). I am interested in understanding how we can use techniques from interpretability in code models to understand training dynamics, steer large models at inference time, reduce hallucinations, and create truly customized systems. I have worked as a data scientist, a machine learning engineer, and as a master's student in biomedical machine learning at Johns Hopkins University.

I’ve been fortunate to work with a number of brilliant people over the years. Here are some fun projects which resulted:
 - I helped out with some work on [Subliminal Learning](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/m5XzhbZjEuF9uRgGR/it-s-owl-in-the-numbers-token-entanglement-in-subliminal-1), which got featured in a [Welsh labs YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUAb6zHXqdI)
 - I led the publication effort for [NDIF](ndif.us), a large-scale AI interpretability infrastructure project, which led to a paper at ICLR.
 - I worked with [Professor Joshua Vogelstein](https://www.neurodata.io) in the Johns Hopkins Biomedical Engineering department on a [pipeline to create graphs from MRI data](https://github.com/neurodata/m2g), which led to a paper in-review at Nature Methods. 
 - I co-authored a [textbook on spectral graph theory](https://www.alex-loftus.com/files/textbook.pdf), which we are publishing with Cambridge University Press. 
 - We developed an open-source project, [Graspologic](https://www.github.com/microsoft/graspologic), which was acquired by Microsoft and used to measure collaboration changes in their workforce during COVID. 
 - I've [given talks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_hcmfdJzF8) for the San Diego Machine Learning meetup group, where I joined a team competing in the [Vesuvius Ink Detection Kaggle Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/vesuvius-challenge-ink-detection). We won 1st place against 1,249 teams for a competition prize pool of $100,000. Our work was featured in [Scientific American](https://x.com/AlexLoftus19/status/1828158652018237536)!
 - I made a [linear algebra tutoring series](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlP-93ntHnnu-ETNlIfelO9C6T8VrADAh&si=iYEkHZXhZbq2jrQC) for my friend, which builds up the mathematical machinery of neural networks starting from the absolute foundations: dot product geometry and linear algebra.

I have a number of academic side-interests, including spectral theory, information geometry, the history of science and mathematics, the mechanics of the visual system, constitutional law, various causal relationships between geography and history, and ethics (I am a big fan of Kant, Hume, Ross, and some modern ethicists like Susan Wolf). I am an avid traveler and am (slowly) learning Spanish.

### Misc
I grew up in Seattle, WA. I was a competitive Starcraft 2 player in high school (grandmaster league - competed/won in seattle-area tournaments!). I studied behavioral neuroscience during my undergraduate years, with a philosophy minor focused on ethics. I got interested in math and programming and started a computational neuroscience club, where I taught weekly seminars. I also spent a lot of time partner dancing and playing guitar at open mic nights!
